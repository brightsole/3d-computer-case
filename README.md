# 3d-computer-case

- [x] Describe
	- as small as possible to fit the mini-itx theme
	- hinge between mobo + gpu cowling & fan tower
	- dual fans in rear air column
	- cable hinge cowling
	- fully 3d printed V1
	- V2 more interconnected design with 3d printed moulds for fiberglass parts

- [x] buy parts [part picker basics](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/t6MXKB)

- [x] prep work
	- [x] connect all parts on-box build [photo](./photos/on-box-build.jpg)
	- [x] re-mount ram to solve post issue
	- [x] install os
	- [x] run benchmark

- [ ] Design V1
	- [x] mobo block
		- [x] base screw plate
	- [ ] gpu block
		- [x] base insert rest plate
		- [ ] power access block
	- [ ] hinge area
	- [x] interconnectors for blocks & block feet
	- [ ] flexible hinged cowling for watercooling channels

- [ ] Redesign issues found in V1
	- [x] mobo block [multiple](./photos/mobo-block-width-issues.jpg) [issues](./photos/mobo-block-screw-issue.jpg)
		- [x] too wide by 10mm 
		- [x] screw body width too small by 1mm
		- [x] under-gpu height too high by 1mm
		- [x] under-cowling support too short by 1.5mm
	- [x] mobo block [cowling support height issue](./photos/mobo-block-cowling-support-height-issue.jpg)
		- [x] under-cowling support now too high, especially to screw on back ([fixed by grinding, model corrected in V1.3](./photos/mobo-block-height-and-screw-issue.jpg))
		- [ ] TO FIX IN V2: screw walls have very little lateral strength because of vertical printing
	- [x] fans base foot [mild issues](./photos/fan-foot-issues.jpg)
		- [x] too narrow by 0.5mm
		- [x] front lip too short by 1.5mm
		- [x] sharp edges with elephant foot overhang, and screw height
	- [x] gpu block [major issue](./photos/gpu-block-issue.jpg)
		- [x] metal cowling hole too narrow

- [x] Print
	- [x] mobo block V1[.1](./files/mobo-holder-v1.1.stl)
	- [x] mobo block V1[.2](./files/mobo-holder-v1.2.stl) redesign
	- [x] fans base foot V1[.1](./files/fan-foot-v1.1.stl)
	- [x] fans base foot V1[.2](./files/fan-foot-v1.2.stl) redesign
	- [x] gpu block V1[.1](./files/gpu-block-v1.1.stl)

- [x] Describe Problems with V1
	- layout [very cluttered](./photos/v1-full-layout.jpg)
	- water cooling cables fight for space with psu cables
	- large space caused by flat gpu extension
	- good airflow; no dust protection
	- no blocks connected
	- no way to move, exposed dangerous places to touch
	- power switches not designed into any block
	- 3d printed plastic not durable
	- neglected to design psu connection block
	- hinge ideas scrapped after seeing pipe cluster

---

- [x] Describe V2
	- rotate cooling block 90Â° to reduce pipe congestion
	- elevate mobo and reduce lateral distance to gpu
	- connect gpu & mobo blocks
	- add handle to top of mobo/cooling tower
	- shorten cables, or create cable hiding tower hinge
	- add cutout to gpu block to insert power switches

- [ ] Redesign V2
	- [ ] back support structure with window for mobo
	- [ ] hinged front cowling for mobo
	- [ ] hollow structure for gpu & power switches

- [ ] print V2
	- [ ] gpu 1 || 2
	- [ ] mobo 1 || 3
	- [ ] psu connection system
	- [ ] cooling tower connectors/supports
	- [ ] handle

---

- [x] Describe V3
	- create designs that are predominantly moulding
	- design 3d printed parts that insert into fiberglass frame
	- buy clear pla+ or PETG for case colour spice
	- larger pieces in the shape of V2, but made of fiberglass with printed inserts, and structural rigidity created by folds

- [ ] Redesign V3

- [ ] print V3 mold pieces

- [ ] Print V3 inserts
